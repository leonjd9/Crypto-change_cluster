# Crypto-change_cluster
The program is capable of analizing data conatainig asset time series return data and organize it in clusters with similar attributes. This is accomplished by using data predicting models which fit and append the data to identify patterns between the samples. These are linked to a point generated by the system and taking inertia between the centroid and the data point as principle guideline to cluster them in multiple sectors. The program also provides the ideal K value or number of clusters to be used during the process. Finally, it can also apply PCA(Principal Component Analysis) to provide a leaner data cluster visualizations.
